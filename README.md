Bot Possession Boilerplate
==========================

Note: talk.js requires cookies to be enabled in the browser. 
If your browser cannot set cookies against a local file, 
you will not be able to run the interfaces successfully by
double-clicking the HTML files. To work around this, navigate
to the root directory of bot-possession-master, and run:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Now you can visit the pages in your browser by visiting [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
